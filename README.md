** Howk's notes for learning Python **

This repository contains a few iPython notebooks to keep notes on some of the issues I've come across / solved in learning Python. Mostly meant for personal use, but feel free to go through / comment on them if you find them helpful.

This work uses `astropy, matplotlib, numpy`.

Current notebooks:

* **LearningPython.basics.ipynb:** How to treat arrays, make basic plots, and even just get the basic importing functionality right.

* **LearningPython.IO.ipynb:** Read and write basic ASCII, LaTeX, and FITS files.



* **LearningPython.SpectralPlots.ipynb:** Slightly more advanced plots, focused on making multiple plots in a stack. Useful for plotting spectral results (includes some GBT data as an example).
